## !downtime study
`!study` is used for the Arcane Study Downtime and use of it looks like: `!study <spell|tome|manual*> <hours>`

#### For example:
`!study quick 4` will study Manual of Quickness of Action for 4 hrs and create/adjust a counter of the same kind

- Note: *If it tries to train you in the wrong thing, it is a list that returns the first matching result so try typing its full name in `""` like:*
`!study "Manual of Quickness of Action" 4`*
