During business hours, the contrasting fabric on the ground beneath displays newly crafted weapons and armor.\n\nLooking around the free side of the building off to the right of the door is the smithing area. There’s a hearth of roughly hewn brick that rises up off and into a chimney to draw the smoke away. A large pair of bellows sits nearby to stoke the flames. The anvil and tools in the workspace are set up meticulously, the latter laid out on a work table along the building wall with a worn stool in front of it.\n\nEntering the shop through the door beside the awning, the most notable thing is how well lit the building is. To the right of the door lies a small window that lets visitors look out to the forge. To the left along the wall, weapon racks are mounted on either side of another window looking onto the street. Light streams in from every direction. In the back-left corner of the room is the shopkeep’s counter that’s adorned with a multitude of small metal puzzles. Beyond that behind a veil of multicolored fabric lies a quiet, private room.\n\nThis is a player-owned shop, so you must wait for the owner player to make purchases.

The interior consists of rows of shelves and display cases on both sides, various arcane and alchemical components on display to potential customers. Near the left a large bookcase sits, containing a generous amount of lore on celestial bodies and otherworldly creatures, in addition to an open index of constellations on a wooden pedestal. In the back of the room sits a polished wooden counter, behind which some of the more expensive products sit on display. More often than not, customers will find the owner, a white scaled Kobold dressed in worn mage’s robes, sitting on a small stool and reading a book, waiting for any customers and eager to answer any questions they may have. A winding set of stairs sits in the far right of the room behind the counter, presumably leading up to the second floor.\n\nThe second floor of the Observatory houses the young mage’s living quarters, in addition to her research area. Neatly organized bookshelves line the walls, along with a Kobold sized desk, nearly always piled high with stellar maps and ancient texts. To the left of the room sits a small bed, at the foot of which sits a wooden chest.\n\nThe final floor of the Observatory houses the tower’s massive telescope, the sides of which contain various arcane sensors and guides to assist the user in locating and divining celestial bodies. In the center of the dimly lit room is a stone table which, upon speaking the command word, will project an image of the stars and their patterns, causing a calm blue light to wash over the room.\n\nThis is a player-owned shop, so you must wait for the owner player to make purchases.

The housing within is little more than a collection of tents, some larger than others for the band's leaders, but nonetheless a very improvised setup. In the center of these tents there is also a sparring ring open to any wishing to test their might, whether they be outsiders or part of the band itself. And if they are newcomers, rest assured the leaders will be watching for new talent. The backside of the camp is less fortified, as it faces the sea, and it is here the earth slopes down to a small inlet where any vessels associated with the Drakes may beach.\n\nThough usually entrance will be denied to anyone but affiliates, exceptions are made for those seeking to employ the mercenaries for expeditions, protection, or simply labor. Additionally, warriors of all kinds are welcome to demonstrate their skill in combat against one another or one of the Drakes. Should they prove themselves competent fighters, they just might have a new job opportunity on their hands. But for all others, it's best not to venture too close.
